# MarioPlatformer
My UE5 Practice. A simple Mario Platformer game from a Udemy course "Unreal Engine 5: Making Mario". I followed this tutorial and tried understanding everything used in UE5. The game was completely made by UE5 blueprints. I've learnt a log about UE5 Gameplay Framework through this exercise.
